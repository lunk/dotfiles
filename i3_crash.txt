i3_crash.txt


i3 often crash if you open gnome/unity stuff such as the control panel. Sometimes even when i open some image or zip i received in slack. The whole system shuts down.
I wanted to change Nautilus file browser to Thunar but the same shit happened as soon as i started thunar.
found it https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132

Found something on somewhere (ubuntu forums i think) that said to add "nomodeset" to kernel boot options

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nomodeset"
sudo update-grub

this seems to fix the crashes but breaks redshift which is super bad for my eyes :/
Even the brightness buttons on the laptop stops working, but at least it doesn't crash
And external monitors doesn't work either, xrandr borks
